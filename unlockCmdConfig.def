; -- * name: 
;      The name of the command to be used to unlock a char.

; -- * link or charpath:
;      The char path, exactly the same as it’s defined in select.def.

; -- * command: 
;      Write here the command to unlock the char (in the same format as commands are written in the char's CMD file), e.g., ~F,F,F,B,B,s.

; -- * holdstart: 
;      If set to 1, the command requires holding the start button to execute.

; -- * unlocked: 
;      If set to true, the char will be unlocked by default.

; -- * unlocksnd: 
;      Group, index and volume of the sound to be played when the command is executed. Sounds must be added to unlockCmdSounds.snd, e.g., 1,0,100.

; -- * anim: 
;      Anim number to be used as the char's portrait when locked. If omitted, the default random select icon from the module will be used.
;      This uses the animations defined in the unlockCmdAnims.air
;      You must add your sprites to unlockCmdSprites.sff.

; -- * unlockanim:
;      The sprite or animation used as the char’s portrait when being unlocked. If omitted, it won’t be used. This uses an animation from unlockCmdAnims.air.

;      You must add your sprites to unlockCmdSprites.sff.
